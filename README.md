## This project involves scraping broker information from a website that requires login. There are two versions of the scraper:

1. **Anonymous Broker Version**: This version scrapes broker information without emails.
2. **Emails Broker Version**: This version scrapes broker information including emails, requiring user authentication.



## Anonymous Broker Version
  This version scrapes broker information excluding emails. It runs relatively fast, taking approximately 6 minutes to complete.
    
  ### Run the script using Python:
    python brokersAsAnon.py


## Emails Broker Version
  This version scrapes broker information including emails. It requires user authentication and takes about 2 hours to complete.
